1)
    The smallest value of N that will cause TestHeap2 to report an
error that no more memory was available was 12. Since the length of each 
object was eight, every object needed (length + 1) words to be stored. The
pattern of object allocation thus follows as:

      obj 0   |  obj 1  |  obj 2  |    |  obj 10
    [-100,-92] [-91,-83] [-82,-74] .... [-10,-1]

    By the time the eleventh object has been allocated there is only one word
of memory left on the heap. That means that when the twelvth object attempts
to be allocated, an out of memory error will be thrown. To visualize this 
scenario, I altered TestHeap2 to execute allocation within a for loop.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; i < 13; ++i) {
             System.out.print("i = " + i);
             test(i);
             System.out.println();
        }  
    }

    public static void test(int N) {
        Heap h = Heap.make(S);
        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
          System.out.println("Allocating object " + i
                           + " at address " + h.alloc(8));
        }
        h.dump();
        System.out.println("Free space remaining = " + h.freeSpace());
    }

    This program failed while performing its last iteration, confirming the fact
that 12 is the smallest value of N that will trigger an error.

    If TestHeap2 included a functioning garbage collector, I would expect it to
get executed when the twelvth object was attempting to be allocated. If the 
collecter found any memory that was no longer being directly referenced, it could
then free up some more space on the heap before continuing to allocate the twelvth
object. However if it could not find any such memory, I would expect it to throw
the same out of memory error that was being triggered without the presence of 
a garbage collecter.

    I would expect the above description of garbage collection behavior to hold for
all values of N and S such that the value of S was greater than the value of N, 
and that the value of S was greater than the length of the object getting allocated.
The value of S obviously needs to be greater than the length of the alocated
object because if you tried to create data storage greater than the total amount
of available memory the garbage collecter may never even need to run for the system
to know that this request is not feasable. The value of S needs to at least be greater
than the value of N because of the fact that each object uses the first word to store
the length of that object. Therefor to even store an object of length one, you would
at the very least need to have a heap of size two. The values of N and the lenght of
the objects being allocated do not need to relate to one another for the behavior
of garbage collection to be observed.

    The implementation for the Twospace methods 'Forward' and 'Scavange' were not 
trivial, but I eventually worked them out none the less. I belive the biggest 
hurdle I encountered while working on this part was explicitly defining the
semantics of these methods. It is difficult to implement them even when you do
know what they should do, but most likely impossible if you don't. 

    I began with the 'Forward' method since it was the first method to get called
in the GarbageCollect routine, and seemed like a logical place to start. I saw that
the roots of the Heap were getting passed into these methods and that their value
was being reassigned by the return value. After reading some of the supporting 
material from our lecture slides it became apparent to me that this method would
be relocating an object on the heap and thus compacting the allocated memory.

    The beginning of the method was not difficult to define, since the instructions
were explicitly outlined by Professor Jones. If the objects value was zero, you
simply return the object. This makes sense since a zero value would mean that the
object had not been explicitly allocated or stored, and therefore would not need
to be forwarded to a new location on the heap. The second check was also fairly
simple, as to seeing if the object had already been previously forwarded. The only
trick was finding where the length of the object would be stored, but after developing
a good model of the heap structure it became apparent that adding the size of the heap
to the passed object and then using that value as an index into the heap would result
in getting the appropriate value.

    The next part of the function was not overly difficult per say, but did take a measure
of finese to get right. The basic function was to use the length of the object to 
copy it from its location on the current heap to its new location on the new heap. The
heap pointer had already been set within the scope of the GarbageCollect method, and
simply incrementing its value upon each iteration of the for loop would allow for the
objects to correctly compact towards the top of the heap. 

    Finally, I needed to set the location of the length in the old heap to contain the
address of the object in the new heap and similtainiously return that value. Again,
this process was not initially obvious, but I managed to dial in the forwarded address
after some trial and error.

Here is the code that I wrote for the 'Forward' method within the TwoSpace class inside
TwoSpace.java:

    /** Forward a reachable object from the current heap into toSpace.
     */
    private int forward(int obj) {
      // If the object is not a pointer, it does not need to be forwarded    
      if(obj >= 0 ) { return obj; } 
      // Retrieve the length of the object by indexing into the heap
      int length = heap[size + obj];    
      // If the length is negative, this object has already been forwarded
      if( length < 0 ) {
          return length;
      }
      //copy over the object from the heap to the copy space
      for(int i = 0; i <= length; ++i) {
          toSpace[hp++] = heap[size + obj + i];
      }
      // set the index in the heap where the length was retrieved to point
      // to the address of the object in the copy space
      return heap[size + obj] = -((size - hp) + length + 1);
    }

---a---

    TestHeap3 allows us to observe both characteristics that were added in part two
of this assignment. First you can see the behavior of the forward method being shown
because before garbage collection the value of h.a is -96 and afterwards it gets
"forwarded to -100. Since this is the first action taken in the garbage collect method,
it does not come as a huge suprise. It does however show how the roots are the first
objects to get copied and how that sets up the scavenge phase. 

    Once all the roots have been copied (in this example there is only one), the 
garbage collector will begin to scavenge the connected objects to add to the heap. It
begins at index zero in the heap where the length of the first root will be, and then
continues to scan each root until all connected objects have been copied from the source
heap to the destination.

    Once this process has completed, we can examine the resulting heap and see the bounty
of our hard work. The heap is now neatly laid out beginning with all the root objects,
and then followed by all other connected objects. All allocated memory is laid out
contiguously starting at the initial address of the heap, and all free memory follows
contiguously starting imediately following the last allocated word and continuing until
the end of the heap. Also all objects that had been allocated but were not directly 
referenced are now gone. Therefore through the copying garbage collector, we have
similtainiously freed up more space and eliminated fragmentation from our heap.

---b---

    If we were to replace the root fields within the scope of the heap with simple
external integer variables, you could simulate the same behavior that is displayed when
building the heap. The trouble begins to arise when you try to collect garbage. The
routine that we are using to perform garbage collection relies on the root fields
within the scope of the Heap class.

    If we had created an integer variable 't' inside the TestHeap3 program, when the
garbage collector got called it would first reset the value of the heap pointer. Then
it would continue by calling the forward method with each root variable. The root 
variables are initialized to the value zero, and when the forward method recieves the
value zero as its argument it simply returns that value. Therefore each call to forward
would do absolutely nothing.

    Next comes the scavenge stage of the copy collector. However this phase would never
even get instantiated. Since no objects were forwarded, the heap pointer kept its value
of zero. The while loop that surrounds the scavenge phase loops on the condition that 
another integers value is less than the value of the heap pointer. Since they will both
be equal to zero, that loop will never get entered. 

    Finally, the source and destination heaps will get exchanged and as a result all
objects will have been collected. You will have a completely empty heap instead of 
achieving the goal of proper garbage collection. Therefore, though it may function
normally to build the initial heap, utilization of the root fields is esential for
this algorithm to work correctly.

---c---

    The garbage collector does not initialize the values of memory to zero once it has
finished. Doing so could create serious optimization issues due to the cost of traversing
large regions of memory every time the garbage collection routine gets ran. Therefore, in
order to save time the value of the heap pointer gets reset and then the top updates when
objects are added to the heap.

When you allocate a new region of memory, the words in the object get reset to zero. This
is less of a hit to optimization because we do this when we need the memory and only 
initialize the values that we need. If we did not reinitialize these values a lot could
potentially go wrong.

    If you had previously deallocated a connected structure of objects, it would get 
ignored during the garbage collection phase and not get added to the heap upon collection.
However, the references in memory would still persist. When that heap eventually got 
swapped back in as the primary heap, there is a chance that that same region of memory
could get allocated. Without a routine to reinitialize the old memory to zero, the allocated
regions could get interpereted as an active portion of the current structure.

When the collector ran again, it may see these values as valid and copy them over as if they
were part of the connected heap. Worse still, if a user referenced this memory it would
either give them unrealistic data or much more likely just completely corrupt the data that
they had accumulated on the heap.

    * Altering the value of S without altering the value of N simply grows or shrinks the size 
of the heap. If the value of S is decreased to be less than sixty five the program will crash
when the garbage collector tries to run due to no available memory. 

    * Increasing the value of N without altering the value of S will result in the program crashing
due to no available memory while trying to allocate the thirteenth object. Decreasing N without
altering the value of S will simply create less objects
    
    * Increasing both S and N will just create more object and a larger stack. If you increase
the two at the same rate, the program will continue functioning in the same manner as it does 
currently (assuming that the current process has enough memory to sustain the size of the heap). 
Decreasing the values will have the inverse effect. The values of S and N must remain greater than
zero.

    * Altering both values independently will either result in the program running normally or in 
a crash depending upon the values chosen for S and N. As a rule, for the program to continue to 
function. The value of S must be greater than or equal to the sum of the integers from zero to N
plus N.

---b---

    Calling garbageCollect in this program results in the connected structure of objects getting
inverted. The last object that gets allocated becomes the first object in the heap, and vice
versa the first becomes the last. It is somewhat analogous to reversing the order of a linked list.
This occurs due to the fact that the call to the store method within the for loop swaps the 
positions in which the root object and newly allocated object are placed. Therefore the value of
h.a gets updated to the starting location of the most recently allocated object on every
iteration of the loop. Then when the garbage collector gets called, it begins by forwarding the
location of the root to the first index of the heap and then scavange does the rest of the work
to invert the heap.

---c--- 

    I implemented an incredibly simple cyclic structure to prove that it is possible to do using
this heap construction, and that the structure is preserved upon garbage collection. It may not
be overly thrilling, but it does display the attributes that I was interested in. First I will
give the test that I wrote:

    class TestHeap8 {
      static final int S = 10;

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Heap h = Heap.make(S);
        // Allocate three words to the h.a root
        h.a = h.alloc(3);
        // Allocate two words to the h.b root
        h.b = h.alloc(2);
        // Allocate one word
        int t = h.alloc(2);

        // Point h.a to h.b
        h.store(h.a, 1, h.b);

        // Point h.a to its self
        h.store(h.a, 2, h.a);

        // Point h.a to t 
        h.store(h.a, 3, t);

        // Point t to h.a
        h.store(t, 1, h.a);

        // Point t to its self
        h.store(t, 2, t);

        // Point h.b to h.a
        h.store(h.b, 1, h.a);

        // Point h.b to its self
        h.store(h.b, 2, h.b);

        System.out.println("Before garbage collection;");
        h.dump();
        System.out.println("Free space remaining = " + h.freeSpace());

        h.garbageCollect();

        System.out.println("\nAfter garbage collection;");
        h.dump();
        System.out.println("Free space remaining = " + h.freeSpace());
      }
    }

The program builds a cyclic structure that looks like this:

                |                 |
                |                 |
                v                 v
              -----             -----
         +-->|     |---------> |     |---+
         |   | h.a |           | h.b |   |
         +---|     |<----------|     |<--+
              -----             -----
               | ^     -----
               | |    |     |---+
               | +----|  t  |   |
               +----->|     |<--+
                       -----

    This is the output of the program showing that the cyclic structures get built,
and that their structure is preserved after the garbage collecor has executed. Note
that for example the Object at address -10 (h.a) has a pointer to -6 (h.b), its self,
and -3 (t). This structure remains identical after the garbage collector has run.

    Before garbage collection;
    Object at address -10, length=3, data=[-6, -10, -3]
    Object at address -6, length=2, data=[-10, -6]
    Object at address -3, length=2, data=[-10, -3]
    Heap allocation pointer: 10
    Free space remaining = 0

    After garbage collection;
    Object at address -10, length=3, data=[-6, -10, -3]
    Object at address -6, length=2, data=[-10, -6]
    Object at address -3, length=2, data=[-10, -3]
    Heap allocation pointer: 10
    Free space remaining = 0
