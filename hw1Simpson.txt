1) Modify the DemoComp compiler to support the following constructs

    ***** All work was done in the C directory of DemoComp*****

    -Multiplication
        
        I began by adding a 'Mult' class in Src.java that extends the 'IExpr' class.
        This class closely follows the pattern of the other 'IExpr' subclasses with only
        minor modifications made to reflect a multiplication operation where nessecary. 
            //Added to Src.java 
            class Mult extends IExpr {
              private IExpr l, r;
              Mult(IExpr l, IExpr r) { this.l = l; this.r = r; }
              
              /**
               * multiply the return values of eval as called from the left and
               * right operands and return the result of the operation
               */
              int    eval(Memory mem) { return l.eval(mem) * r.eval(mem); }
              
              /**
               * print the operation as multiplication show with an asterisk
               */
              String show() { return "(" + l.show() + " * " + r.show() + ")"; }
              
              /**
               * Construct stack frame of multiplication operator
               * to compile source code into target representation 
               */  
              Code compileTo(Reg reg, Code next) {
                Reg tmp = new Reg();
                return l.compileTo(tmp,
                       r.compileTo(reg,
                       new Op(reg, tmp, '*', reg, next)));
              }
            }   

        I also modified the method  "run" inside the Op class within Target.java 
        to include a case for the added  multiplication operator. This adds a new 
        instruction to the "assembly" that will evaluate multiplication operation
        and allow the translated expression to be evaluated in the target language.
  
            //Added to Target.java, Op class, within "run" method
            case '*' : r.set(x.get() * y.get());
                       break;
 
        These changes were sufficient for being able to implement a multiplication construct
        for the DemoComp complier. To test that my alterations were correct, I went into 
        Main.java and created a new function. This function contained a copy of the ast and 
        copmilation code that was already present in this file. I altered the abstact syntax
        tree to perform a Mult operation and also altered a few other values.

            /**
             * An AST that I used for testing
             */
            Stmt s
               = new Seq(new Assign("t", new Int(1)),
                 new Seq(new Assign("i", new Int(1)),
                 new Seq(new While(new LT(new Var("i"), new Int(5)),
                                   new Seq(new Assign("t", new Mult(new Var("t"), new Var("i"))),
                                           new Assign("i", new Plus(new Var("i"), new Int(1))))),
                         new Print(new Var("t")))));

        This test calculates four factorial. The result of this program correctly printed 
        the value 24 as the output of interpertation and compilation. I also played around with 
        changing the AST to ensure the correctness of my code, and the values continued to
        print as expected.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    -Not

        This case was somewhat more involved than multiplication, mainly because there were
        no unary boolean expressions from which I could base a pattern. The only major difference
        was in the compile to method where null gets passed in as the second argument, the rest
        was fairly similar.

            //Added to Src.java 
            class Not extends BExpr {
                private BExpr e;
                Not(BExpr e) { this.e = e; }
                
                /**
                 * negate the return value of eval method
                 */
                boolean eval(Memory mem) { return !e.eval(mem); }
                /**
                 * display the not construct as a function call
                 */
                String show() { return "not (" + e.show() + ")"; }
                /**
                 * call compileTo method passing in null for second arg since
                 * not is a unary operator
                 */
                Code compileTo(Reg reg, Code next) {
                    return e.compileTo(reg, new Op(reg, null, '!', reg, next));
                }
            }

        Again this construct also needed an addition to the target code Op class so that
        the instructions could be translated during compilation. Since there only one 
        register in action it loads the bool value, negates that value, and then stores
        the updated value back to the same register.

            //Added to Target.java, Op class, witin "run" method
            case '!' : r.setBool( !y.getBool() );
                       break;
   
        This next part wasn't strictly necessary, but it made sense to add a Bool non
        terminal to the grammar so I went ahead and did so. It stores an integer flag,
        and interperets, prints, and compiles boolean values based upon the integer
        value

            //Added to Src.java
            class Bool extends BExpr {
                private int flag;
                Bool(int flag) { this.flag = flag; }
               
                /**
                 * Zero value evaluates to false, any other value evaluates to true
                 */ 
                boolean eval(Memory mem) { 
                   if( 0 == flag) {
                      return false;
                  }
                  return true;
                }
                
                /**
                 * Zero value prints false, any other value prints true
                 */  
                String show() { 
                  if( 0 == flag) {
                      return "false";
                  }
                  return "true";
                }
                
                 /**
                 * assigns the flag value to a register
                 */ 
                Code compileTo(Reg reg, Code next) {
                  return new Immed(reg, flag, next);
                }
           }

        To test the not construct I did as before and created some AST structures that I
        could then run and evaluate the returned interpereted and compiled values. This
        test simply reads as if(not(true)){ print 0;} else {print 42;}. Upon running the code,
        it correctly prints the value 42 both through interperetation and compilation

            //An AST to test the Not construct
                Stmt s
                    = new If(new Not( new Bool(1)),
                      new Print(new Int(0)),
                      new Print(new Int(42)));

    -Even

        Constructing the pattern for an even operator was not at all difficult since it
        shared many characteristics with the Not operator. The biggest difference was that
        it had an IExpr field rather than a BExpr, and that the logic to emulate the expected
        behavior was slightly more involved.
            
            //Added to Src.java
            class Even extends BExpr {
                private IExpr v;
                Even(IExpr v) { this.v = v; }
                
                /**
                 * checking if the value of v is even with mod operator
                 */
                boolean eval(Memory mem) { 
                    if( 0 == v.eval(mem) % 2 ) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    return false;
                }
                /**
                 * display the not construct as a function call
                 */
                String show() { return "even (" + v.show() + ")"; }
                /**
                 * call compileTo method passing in null for second arg since
                 * not is a unary operator
                 */
                Code compileTo(Reg reg, Code next) {
                    return v.compileTo(reg, new Op(reg, null, '%', reg, next));
                }
            }

        Again, a new case needed to be added to
